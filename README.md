# Open Innovation License
The Open Innovation Open Source License promotes the idea of technology being used in order to make the world a better place. Not only this, but also many problems people have in regards to many different open source hardware and software offerings are tackled by lots of the terminology of this license. This license is partially inspired by many companies wanting to release technology into the world commercially that can still be used by others. It also aims to be easier to incorporate in terms of just a license file, instead of what can eventually become thousands of headers.
